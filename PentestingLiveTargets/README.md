# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets
### Chieh-Huang Chen
Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

### Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation

I logged into the website and copy the SESSION ID given. I then go on another browser that's not logged in and replaced the SESSION ID there with the logged in SESSION ID. This hijacked website that steal user's information.

### Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)

I injected SQL in the Salesperson Page which results in a database error. This error tells us we can do all kinds of SQL injection through this vulnerability.

## Green

### Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

I tested the existing username "jmonroe99" and found out that when the text is bold when the user enters an existing username and the text is not bold when the user enters a non-existing username.

### Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

I sent the XSS through the feedback on the public website and it gives me an XSS in the staff site.

## Red

### Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

I modified the CSRF token on the Blue Website and tried to update it and didn't work. However, the Red Website works.

### Vulnerability #2: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

On the Blue website, when I entered an invalid ID on the GET parameters for the website, it redirects me to the main page. However, on the Red website, changing the ID gives me the employees that were not ready to display for the public or the person got fired.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

I had some challenges in finding the Cross-Site Request Forgery because I didn't look into the source code for the website. Overall, the challenges I did were pretty straightforward and easy to understand thanks to the CTF challenges I did in from Week 1 to Week 5.
