## Any issues you encountered
I had an issue when installing [MHN](https://github.com/threatstream/mhn) where I needed permission to retrieve a repository from Hurricane Labs. I resolved this conflict after finding out that other developers replaced the Github user to couozu in [scripts/install_hpfeeds.sh](https://github.com/threatstream/mhn/blob/master/scripts/install_hpfeeds.sh).
